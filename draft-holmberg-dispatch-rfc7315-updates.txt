               P-Access-Network-Info in SIP ACK requests
               draft-holmberg-dispatch-rfc7315-updates-00

Abstract

   3GPP has identified cases where different SIP P-prefixed header
   fields, defined in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP requests and
   responses currently not allowed according to RFC 7315.  This document
   updates RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected P-
   header fields in such requests and responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of erratas that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occured when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by
   RFC 7315.

1.  Introduction

   The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases
   where different Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]
   P-prefixed header fields, defined in RFC 7315 [RFC7315], need to be
   included in SIP requests and responses currently not allowed
   according to RFC 7315.  This document updates RFC 7315, in order to
   allow inclusion of the affected P- header fields in such requests and
   responses.

   In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set
   of erratas that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix
   misalignments that occured when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by
   RFC 7315.

   This document updates RFC 7315 [RFC7315], by allowing the insertion
   of the P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK requests.

   As the P- prefixed header field are mainly used in (and in most
   cases, only defined for) networks defined by the 3rd-Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP), where the updates defined in this
   document are already defined [TS.3GPP.24.229], the updates are not
   seen to cause backward compatibility concerns.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Errata to RFC 7315

   This section defines the errata that is to be submitted against RFC
   7315.  The scope of the errata is only alignment between RFC 3455 and
   RFC 7315.

5.7.  New Headers

   The P-Associated-URI header field can appear in SIP REGISTER method
   and 2xx resonses.  The P-Called-Party-ID header field can appear in
   SIP INVITE, OPTIONS, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and MESSAGE methods and all
   responses.  The P-Visited-Network-ID header field can appear in all
   SIP methods except ACK, BYE, and CANCEL and all responses. The
   P-Access-Network-Info header field can appear in all SIP methods
   except ACK and CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Vector header field can appear
   in all SIP methods except CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Function-Addresses
   header field can appear in all SIP methods except ACK and CANCEL.
