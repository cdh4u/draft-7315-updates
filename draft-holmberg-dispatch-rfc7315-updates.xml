        <t>
            The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project 3GPP has identified cases where different 
            SIP private header extensions referred to as P- header fields, defined
            in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP requests and responses currently not
            allowed according to RFC 7315. This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow
            inclusion of the affected P- header fields in such requests and responses.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set of errata 
            that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix misalignments that occurred
            when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by RFC 7315.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases where different
            Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default"/> 
            private header extensions referred to as P- header fields, defined in RFC 7315 
            <xref target="RFC7315" pageno="false" format="default"/>, need to be included in SIP 
            requests and responses currently not allowed according to RFC 7315. This document updates 
            RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected P- header fields 
            in such requests and responses.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set of errata 
            that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix misalignments that occurred
            when RFC 3455 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3455"/> was updated and 
            obsoleted by RFC 7315.
        </t>
        <t>
            This document updates RFC 7315 <xref target="RFC7315" pageno="false" 
            format="default"/>, by allowing the insertion of the
            P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK requests.
        </t>
        <t>
            As the P- header fields are mainly used in (and in most cases, only defined for) 
            networks defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where the updates
            defined in this document are already defined <xref target="TS.3GPP.24.229" 
            pageno="false" format="default"/>, the updates are not seen to cause backward 
            compatibility concerns.

        <section title="General">
            <t>
                RFC 7315 contains contradicting statements regarding the 
                usage of SIP P- header fields in SIP requests and responses, which leave 
                the presence of the SIP P- header fields in the SIP requests and responses 
                open to interpretation, and different implementations. Statements in 
                section 5.7 are not aligned with the definitions and usage of the SIP P- 
                header fields specified in section 4.
            </t>
			<t>
                This section defines the errata that is to be submitted against RFC 7315. The scope
                of the errata is only alignment between RFC 3455 and RFC 7315.
            </t>
            <t>
                NOTE: In the case of the P-Called-Party-ID header field, allowing it in PUBLISH
                requests was deliberately done in RFC 7315. It will therefore not be impacted
                by the errata.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Correction to section 5.7 of RFC 7315">
            <t>
                The errata makes the following changes:

                        P-Associated-URI: Remove statement that the header field can 
                        appear in the SIP REGISTER method.
                    </t>
					<t>
                        P-Called-Party-ID: Delete statement that the header 
                        field can appear in SIP responses. Add statement that the P-Called-Party-ID 
                        header field can appear in the SIP REFER method.
					</t>
					<t>
                        P-Visited-Network-ID: Delete statement that the header 
                        field can appear in SIP responses. Add statement that the P-Visited-Network-ID 
                        header field cannot appear in the SIP NOTIFY, PRACK, INFO and UPDATE methods. 
					</t>
                    <t>
                        P-Access-Network-Info: Add statement that header field can appear in

                        responses. Add statement that the header field can not appear in the SIP ACK
                        method.
					</t>
                    <t>
