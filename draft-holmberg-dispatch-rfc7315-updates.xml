        <t>
            3GPP has identified cases where different SIP P-prefixed header fields, defined
            in RFC 7315, need to be included in SIP requests and responses currently not
            allowed according to RFC 7315. This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow
            inclusion of the affected P- header fields in such requests and responses.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set of erratas 
            that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix misalignments that occured
            when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by RFC 7315.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
            The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has identified cases where different
            Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261" pageno="false" format="default"/> 
            P-prefixed header fields, defined in RFC 7315 <xref target="RFC7315" pageno="false" format="default"/>, 
            need to be included in SIP requests and responses currently not allowed according to RFC 7315. 
            This document updates RFC 7315, in order to allow inclusion of the affected P- header fields 
            in such requests and responses.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to get a complete picture, this document also contains a set of erratas 
            that are to be filed against RFC 7315, in order to fix misalignments that occured
            when RFC 3455 was updated and obsoleted by RFC 7315.
        </t>

        <t>
            This document updates RFC 7315 <xref target="RFC7315" pageno="false" 
            format="default"/>, by allowing the insertion of the
            P-Access-Network-Info header field in SIP ACK requests.
        </t>
        <t>
            As the P- prefixed header field are mainly used in (and in most cases, only defined for) 
            networks defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where the updates
            defined in this document are already defined <xref target="TS.3GPP.24.229" 
            pageno="false" format="default"/>, the updates are not seen to cause backward 
            compatibility concerns.

5.7.  New Headers

   The P-Associated-URI header field can appear in SIP REGISTER method
   and 2xx resonses.  The P-Called-Party-ID header field can appear in
   SIP INVITE, OPTIONS, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, and MESSAGE methods and all
   responses.  The P-Visited-Network-ID header field can appear in all
   SIP methods except ACK, BYE, and CANCEL and all responses. The
   P-Access-Network-Info header field can appear in all SIP methods
   except ACK and CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Vector header field can appear
   in all SIP methods except CANCEL.  The P-Charging-Function-Addresses
   header field can appear in all SIP methods except ACK and CANCEL.
